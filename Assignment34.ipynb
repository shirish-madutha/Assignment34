    "\"\"\" The Filter method is a feature selection technique used in machine learning to\n",

    "characteristics of individual features independently of the learning algorithm used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Filter method generally works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Scoring: In this step, each feature is assigned a score that reflects its\n",

    "employed, such as correlation coefficient, chi-square test, mutual information, or\n",
    "information gain.\n",

    "Correlation coefficient: Measures the linear relationship between a feature and the \n",
    "target variable.\n",
    "Chi-square test: Assesses the statistical dependence between categorical features and \n",
    "the target variable.\n",
    "Mutual information: Estimates the amount of information shared between a feature and  \n",
    "the target variable.\n",
    "Information gain: Quantifies the reduction in entropy (uncertainty) of the target\n",
    "variable given a feature.\n",
    "Ranking: Once the scores are computed, the features are ranked based on their individual\n",
    "scores. The higher the score, the more relevant the feature is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Subset Selection: At this stage, a predetermined number of top-ranked features or\n",

    "while discarding those that contribute less to the predictive power or may introduce noise.\n",
